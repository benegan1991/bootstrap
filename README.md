RWD Bootstrap
===================


This is a RWD Bootstrap leveraging **Foundation 5, Gulp, Browserify** and a host of other Gulp task runners such as Uglify, BrowserSync, SASS, JSHint and Modernizr.

I've also included some Bower Components such as jQuery 1 and 2, jQuery Easing, Waypoints, Picturefill, Scroll Reveal. You may never use these but I like to include them as I personally use them a lot.

Installation

This boostrap requires **NPM Package Manager** and **Bower Package Manager**. Please download and install these first before attempting the install.

Run...

1. git clone https://github.com/kode8/bootstrap.git

That's it.

Foundation overrides and variables and component imports can be found in /src/_bootstrap.scss
