RWD Bootstrap
===================


This is a RWD Bootstrap leveraging **Foundation 5, Gulp, Browserify** and a host of other Gulp task runners such as Uglify, BrowserSync, SASS, JSHint and Modernizr.

I've also included some Bower Components such as jQuery 1 and 2, jQuery Easing, Waypoints, Picturefill, Scroll Reveal. You may never use these but I like to include them as I personally use them a lot.

Installation
-------------------

This boostrap requires **NPM Package Manager** and **Bower Package Manager**. Please download and install these first before attempting the install.

Run...

1. git clone https://github.com/kode8/bootstrap.git
2. cd bootstrap
3. Install https://imageoptim.com/ for MacOS, this is used for the automatic image compression in Gulp
3. npm install
4. bower install
5. gulp

That's it.

Foundation overrides and variables and component imports can be found in /src/_bootstrap.scss
